    <h2>Why I Started CodingWorld</h2>
    <p><em>May 30, 2025</em></p>
    <p>
      I created this blog to hold myself accountable and improve my consistency in coding. 
      My main goal is to develop strong problem-solving skills and help others by sharing my knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll be solving LeetCode problems, building Python projects, and sharing my learning journey here. 
      If you're a CS student, junior dev, or hobbyist like me — welcome to the journey!
