  <main>
    <p>Let’s be honest—starting LeetCode is hard. You open a problem, feel stuck, scroll through solutions, and close the tab. That used to be me.</p>

    <p>But recently, I created a step-by-step system that helps me stay consistent and actually solve problems. Here’s how I do it </p>

    <h2> Step 1: Pick the Right Problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with <strong>Easy</strong> problems -> yes, even if you’ve coded before</li>
      <li>Follow a curated list: I use LeetCode’s 75, Neetcode, or Blind 75</li>
      <li>Track what I solve in Notion or a markdown file -> consistency hack 💯</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Read, Don't Panic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Read the question slowly</li>
      <li>Write down what it asks in my own words</li>
      <li>Sketch a few examples on paper or with comments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Step 3: Brute Force First</h2>
    <p>Even if it’s not efficient, I try the first approach that comes to mind. It helps me get <strong>unstuck</strong> and build confidence.</p>

    <pre><code># Example: Two Sum
for i in range(len(nums)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
            return [i, j]
</code></pre>

    <h2>⚙ Step 4: Refactor and Optimize</h2>
    <p>Once it works, I ask: can I make it faster? Can I use a dictionary? A set?</p>

    <pre><code># Optimized
seen = {}
for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    diff = target - num
    if diff in seen:
        return [seen[diff], i]
    seen[num] = i
</code></pre>

    <h2> Step 5: Write Down What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> What was the trick?</li>
      <li> What topic was involved? (HashMap, Two Pointers...)</li>
      <li> What will I do differently next time?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>! Bonus: I Turn It Into Content</h2>
    <p>I write blog posts or YouTube shorts about my problem-solving process. It helps me review and build a public portfolio.</p>

    <h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Solving problems isn’t about being smart. It’s about showing up every day—even when your brain feels slow. </p>
